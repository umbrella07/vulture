<h1>Vulture</h1>
<p>
Vulture is a 3 playered board game that has mini games. We decided to base the game off of the Mario. Our game is made for high school stuents. To 
build the 3D characters, we used MAYA. Building the code we used Python. To play the game place the characters on the board. Follow the board
and try to land on mini games - they give you an advantage. If you do land ona mini game try to earn a high score the higher the score the more 
advantages you get. Avoid landing on downgrades that could make you move back to the start or lose a turn roling the dice. Overall the primary
goal of the game is to get to the end before the other players do.
